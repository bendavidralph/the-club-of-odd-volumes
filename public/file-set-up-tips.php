        DARK GARMENTS
        <br>There is a tick box to remove white background. If your mock-up is showing a white background 
        around your design, we can remove this (on most designs) and print with a transparent background. 
        We will email through a preview for you to approve as the computer mock-up wll not correctly show this. 
        <br><br>
        If you are a photshop wizz, all areas to print white should be R253 G253 B253 (If left R255 G255 B255 they will not print) 
        Place design on a black background R0 G0 B0 and this will be transparent (not printed) 
        For grey / coloured garments place on a transparent background and save as a tiff.</p>

            We proportunately re-size artwork to fit kids / adults tees depending on the garment size.
            <br><br>
            Tee / Jumper mock-up shown on a medium mens. Because the maximum print size is 40 x 45cm, this fills less space on a XL+ size garment. 
            <br><br>
            We can print double sided for an additional cost.
            <br><br>
            We can not print to the edge very seams, all garments are pre-sewn and limited by max print size.   <br><br>
            Also no prints on the sleeves of tees and jumpers or  on the inside back.

           As well as a large central print we can also print in two halves to fill the space. 
            <br><br>
            Each half is printed seperately and re-alighned by eye. Because of this we can not gaurantee two halves will line up to the exact milimetre and this is why we can NOT cut a solid image in half (see example A). 
<br><br>
            It must have a white background break in the design.
<br><br>
            The join does not need to be exactly in the centre or a perfectly straight line. (see example B) This can be two interlocking peices. They must not be longer than 66cm high when combined, or 40cm high indiviulally. e.g one half could be 40 x 45cm and the other half 26 x 45cm.
<br><br>
            The computer mock-up may not display this interlocked, but we will understand how they need to be printed if the two halves equal 66cm high. (see example C)
<br><br>
            We can not print to the very edge seams. All tea towels are pre-sewn and limited by max print size.
