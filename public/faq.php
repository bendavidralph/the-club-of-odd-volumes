            <h3>DIGITAL PRINTING</h3>
           
            <p>We use a 'direct-to-garment' digital printer. 
            <br>
            <br>This means you can print full-colour, high resolution graphics with no expensive setup cost. 
            <br>
            <br> With no minimums we can print one at a time so you can test designs on your audience without committing to bulk orders. You can also mix and match designs within the same style to qualify for the bulk discounts. <a href="custom-printing-bulk-pricing.php">More info on pricing here.</a>
            <br>
            <br> All garments are pre-sewn before printing. Because of this we cannot print to the very edge. We also cannot print onto sleeves and tote handles.
            <br>
            <br>Max print size 40 x 45cm.</p>
