    We may need you to provide a username and email address for us to give you access to some parts of our website.

    We currently do not have a mailing list so will not use your email after purchases are complete to spam your inbox.

    If we are contacted in-regard to custom printing copyright infringement, we may share information with governmental agencies or other companies assisting us to prevent or investigate illegal activity.
