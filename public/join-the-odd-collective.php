            <br><p>
            The Odd Collective is a community of 20 artists showcased in our curated online store. (Please note this is a selection process. We do not automatically upload your custom orders to our store.)
            <br><br>
            With no hassle and zero cost, artists can make their designs available on our range of textiles. We set everything up online, promote through our social media, print-to-order, deal with customers and post directly to them. At the end of each month give the profits to the artists.
            <br><br>
            We are a small company, so care about our twenty artists. Customers can support up-and-coming talent without having to scroll through millions of products and every six months we rotate at least half our artists. This way everyone gets a chance to get involved and we can keep customers stay up to date with the coolest of the cool by serious artists.
